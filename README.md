## Install and Run

Jiffy was designed on a mac. It has not been tested on any other machines. After cloning the repository to your local machine, **cd into the Jiffy directory and run the bash command "npm run start"**. This command will run npm install across all sub directories and initialize an Express server on port 3001 as well as a React server on port 3000. The script should terminate by opening a tab in your internet browser to http://localhost:3000.


## Future Direction

Next, I would have liked to implement a search bar so that users could view .gifs of their choosing.
